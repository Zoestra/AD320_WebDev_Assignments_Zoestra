			<h2>Project Neumann</h2>
			<p>
				Space simulation and exploration game, based on the novel "we Are Legion
				(We Are Bob)", and the Bobiverse series. Project Neumann puts you in
				control of a Von Neumann probe, sent out into the galaxy from a dying
				earth, tasked with finding a planet suitable for human colonization.
				Project Neumann is being created as a Senior Capstone project by Zoestra
				Hammer, and Kala Reik, with Jacob Fifield acting as a project advisor.

			<h2>Black Myth Wuziqi</h2>
			<p>
				Now available on Itch.io, Black Myth Wuziqi was created for the 2025
				Pirate Software Game Jam. Black Myth Wuziqi is an interpretation of the
				classic chinese connect-5 game, Wuziqi, but with added powerup pieces.
				Created in only 2 weeks by Zoestra Hammer, Jacob Fifield, Kayla Reik,
				Tina Jin, and Luiziz.
			</p>
			<h2>Ramen Shop Warriors</h2>
			<p>
				Long running Cyberpunk Red campaign set in Cyberpunk 2077's Night City.
				What began as a simple playthrough of RTalsorian's *The Jacket* campaign
				module has now extended into a year-long campaign hunting down *The
				H1ve*, a gang of Mindflayer Netrunners bent on domination. For this
				campaign, I have produced dozens of high-quality battlemaps, and have
				maintained a locally hosted FoundryVTT server. Currently, the Ramen Shop
				Warrirors are fighting their way through a gigantic, custom designed
				10-floor dungeon with the help of a large cast of NPCs.
