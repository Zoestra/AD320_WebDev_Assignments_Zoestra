			<h2>Zoestra Hammer</h2>
			<h3>Game Designer</h3>
			<p>
				I have been designing games since 2010, when my tabletop roleplaying
				group began working on a superhero expansion for the World of Darkness
				roleplaying system. More recently, I have been a Referee running a
				long-running Cyberpunk Red game. I have lots of experience designing
				maps, balancing encounters and mechanics, and crafting stories to
				entertain my players. In addition to my long running campaign, and some
				time as a GM for a cyberpunk Living Community, I have designed several
				"holiday special" one-shot campaigns. I have also started working on
				Video Game design, and have participated in several game jams. I am
				currently working on Project Neumann, a space simulation game, as my
				capstone project at North Seattle College.
